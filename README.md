## Scrapi

Scrapi is a simple open-source URL-Scraper. This web scraper allows you to provide a base URL, and it will recursively traverse and scrape all related URLs from the given website. It starts by visiting the provided base URL, collecting all links on the page, and continuing to traverse through each link until the entire website has been scraped. The scraper efficiently handles multiple pages and ensures every page is visited only once. Ideal for gathering large datasets or analyzing the structure of web content.
